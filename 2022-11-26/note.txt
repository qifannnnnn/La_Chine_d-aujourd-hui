The fire in Urumqi is like a catalyst for all kinds of protests, from communities to universities. More than 30 universities in China today protested against endless PCR tests, school lockdowns, and ridiculously strict censorship. People in Shanghai gathered on the Urumqi Street in memorial of 10 deaths in Urumqi, and in the meanwhile, they even shouted out the most radical claims of the day - they demanded that the Communist Party should step down. In the end, the police intervened and the gathering ended.

Mao Zedong said "星星之火，可以燎原" -- noboday wants violence ... and these protests will finally disappear in the wind. However, as young people we have to keep the faith in us and believe that the future will eventually belong to us.
