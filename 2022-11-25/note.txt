1. Big fire in Ürümqi, Xinjiang, 10 deaths. The officers claim that the residents could get out but for some reason they didn't. The truth is that the community where the building caught on fire lies is in quarantine, blocked by steel walls. Fire exits were not available. Lots of articles disclosing the facts were deleted on Weibo, Wechat, etc.

2. It's being told that lots of people from Chongqing refuse to do the PCR test, as they doubt if the results are correct and reliable.
